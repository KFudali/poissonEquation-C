# Poisson's equation
Simple cpp code that solves Poisson's equation f = (d^2f)/(dx^2) + (d^2f)/(dy^2). Currently f is set to 0. The code uses a simple matrix class written as an exercise without much thought put into it. To plot the solution a modified VTK example was used (reference: https://examples.vtk.org/site/Cxx/Plotting/Histogram2D/)

As an exercise in qt interfaces and vtk library i added some silly GUI and plotting visible below:
